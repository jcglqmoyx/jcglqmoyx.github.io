Although Iâ€™m not yet very experienced with all the new features of the language, Iâ€™ve been following its development and the growing community for quite some time. Iâ€™m obsessed with Rustâ€™s high performance and memory safety. Over the past one or two years, Iâ€™ve written several projects in Rust, and Iâ€™ve always been impressed with how fast and stable the runtime is, along with its efficient use of memory. Iâ€™ve also tried solving LeetCode problems with Rust, but I eventually gave up because the languageâ€™s strict syntax rules made it difficult to solve competitive programming problems.
